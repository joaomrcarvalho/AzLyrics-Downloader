# AzLyrics-Downloader

Python project based on https://github.com/FrancescoGuarneri/AzLyricsAPI, but lets you download all available lyrics from a list of inserted artists and saves each of them on a different .txt file. 

Since the server disconnects you from making too much attemps by minute, there is a timer that only download one lyrics per 15 seconds. You can change that if you want.

Just run the script and insert a list of artists separeted by '*' and it should work. Any problems send me a message of fix it :)
