# AzLyrics-Downloader

Python project based on https://github.com/FrancescoGuarneri/AzLyricsAPI, but let's you download all available lyrics from a list of inserted artists. Since the server disconnects you from making too much attemps by minute, there is a timer that only download one lyrics per 15 seconds. You can change that if you want.
